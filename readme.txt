Simple plugin that allows you to point a page to an outside site.

== Description ==

I no longer maintain this plugin. For more functionality, check out this one: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-links-to/

Simple plugin that allows you to point a page to an outside site. If you add a custom field whose key is "link to," and whose value is a URI, any generated link to that page will point to the given URI. This way you can create page links in your menu that point outside your site.
